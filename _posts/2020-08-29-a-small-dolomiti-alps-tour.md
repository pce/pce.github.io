# a small Dolomiti Tour


First Stop: Merano, beautiful ways to walk arround, for example the "Tappeinerweg".  

## Lago di Carezza

Next Stop in South-Tirol: Karersee (Lago di Carezza) - i would defenitily consider the region harmful, if you are vulnerable to the culture-shock desease ;-)

The Colors there came from a magican who dropped a rainbow in the Lake.

### rosegarden (Rosengarten/Catinaccio)

Theres a mountain group, the rosegarden, with glowing Alps, the optical phenomenon of Alpenglow, which came from a saga of Re Laurin.  
The rosegrove changes their color to red, purple or pink during or after sunset.

To walk in a breeze of fresh air in silence and to see the sunrise is also a Joy.

At the "Lago del Mis" is an amazing path "Val Falcina" arround an arm of the Lake.

After 1-2 hours walk it is like an jungle (botanical and animals, even Ghosts (i read they formed the rocks or stones))

There's a Parking Lot at Case Batot. Follow the sign to Rif. 7 Alpini, on that path, take the second way to Bus del Buson (we had that recommendation and it was great).
