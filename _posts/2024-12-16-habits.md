# One Percent Change

I have heard that James Clear recommends in his book 1% method to efficiently acquire new habits, to link something to it.
In my case, to pay more attention to replicability on my new computer and to use more Docker for global installations of deps or libs that are linked during a build.
However, it was easier than I thought.
Instead of NVM or Volta on my machine, run the Docker image with node directly.
Actually, only the Vite configuration had to be adapted and npm commands had to be prefixed with docker-compose run, for example:
`docker-compose run web npm install <package_name>`.
However, I hadn't expected that working offline with Docker wouldn't work so out of the box, but I'll get there.

For CMake projects, instead of using brew or globally installed libs, using vcpkg or gitmodules makes build or deployment much more replicable.
