## Shell Essentials

- zsh with [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix)
- [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator/) still rocks  
- [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
- [Fira Font](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) Mozilla's monospace typeface designed for Firefox OS (Coding with Style ;-)) 
- solarized [vim](https://www.vim.org/) with vundele (nerdtree, ...) 
- [htop](http://hisham.hm/htop/)
- [nethogs](https://github.com/raboof/nethogs) Linux 'net top' tool


## Tools

- [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/) (graphical merge commits)


## Graphical Environments

Clicking and pointing was so boring in my Childhood, because i had a graphical Enviroment (GEOS) with a joystick, but without a mouse ;-). I sticked to the BASIC-Shell like most of us C64ers did.  


### Gnome 3 

- [Arc-Dark Theme](https://github.com/nicohood/arc-theme) Switching from awesomeWM to Gnome3-Shell 
- [ArchLinux Update Indicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1010/archlinux-updates-indicator/)


### awesomeWM and XFCE 

Sometimes i think about a switch back to XFCE or to [awesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/).  

BTW i used to stick with vanilla debian or debian-based distros like crunchbang. In 2015 i gave archlinux a try on my workstation and never looked back. For me is Linux the Operating System that made OS Choice a independent Choice. I still use and enjoy, due to MOTU hardware, an airmac with macOSX for Soundrecording.
